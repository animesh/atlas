Defining Samples
================

Annotation
----------

Samples are defined under "samples" and have a unique name that does not
contain spaces or underscores (dashes are accepted). To only annotate, a
sample needs ``fasta`` defined::

    samples:
        sample-1:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-1_contigs.fasta
        sample-2:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-2_contigs.fasta

All other annotation parameters can be defined following samples. See
:ref:`annotation`.


Annotation and Quantification
-----------------------------

To get counts, we need to define FASTQ file paths that will be mapped back
to the FASTA regions.

In addition to specifying FASTQ paths for each sample, the configuration will
also need to contain::

    quantification: true


Interleaved
```````````

Reads are always assumed to be paired-end, so we only need to specify
``fastq``::

    samples:
        sample-1:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-1_contigs.fasta
            fastq: /project/data/sample-1_pe.fastq
        sample-2:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-2_contigs.fasta
            fastq: /project/data/sample-2_pe.fastq

Paired-end
``````````

In this case, we create a list using YAML_ syntax for both R1 and R2 indexes::

    samples:
        sample-1:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-1_contigs.fasta
            fastq:
                - /project/data/sample-1_R1.fastq
                - /project/data/sample-1_R2.fastq
        sample-2:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-2_contigs.fasta
            fastq:
                - /project/data/sample-2_R1.fastq
                - /project/data/sample-2_R2.fastq


Single-end
``````````

As data are assumed to be paired-end, we need to add ``paired: false``::

    samples:
        sample-1:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-1_contigs.fasta
            fastq: /project/data/sample-1_se.fastq
            paired: false
        sample-2:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-2_contigs.fasta
            fastq: /project/data/sample-2_se.fastq
            paired: false


Example
-------

A complete example for annotation and quantification for samples with
paired-end reads in separate and in interleaved FASTQs::


    samples:
        sample-1:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-1_contigs.fasta
            fastq: /project/data/sample-1_pe.fastq
        sample-2:
            fasta: /project/bins/sample-2_contigs.fasta
            fastq:
                - /project/data/sample-2_R1.fastq
                - /project/data/sample-2_R2.fastq

    quantification: true
